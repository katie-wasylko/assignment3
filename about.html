        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p class="dropcap"><strong>Flo's Turtles</strong> was founded in 2008 by Flo Brown, who's love of turtles inspired her to start the business. As a young girl, Flo had always wanted a turtle as a pet but, they were not sold in her local pet store. She had always wanted to work with animals and hopefully one day work with them. She then became a veterinarian with a specialization in reptiles.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>I have always loved animals and made it a goal of mine to devote my life to taking care of them. Turtles are amazing creatures that are widely misunderstood.<span>-Flo Brown</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="dropcap"><strong>Flo's Turtles</strong> is located in Calabogie, Ontario. Flo wanted to create a santcuary for the turtles sold in her shop, keeping them as close to their natural environment as possible.
